How to add content to these pages
*********************************

.. note::
    Firstly make sure you have sphinx installed: http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/install.html
    as well as the sphinx-alabaster theme: https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster

The pages are hosted on LocalDocs but the content is all created within the Python git repository. So do the following in order to update:

1. **git pull**
2. Edit what you need to (see below for how to achieve this)
3. **make html**
4. **git push**
5. Make sure you are on a filesystem that can `see` **/tools/WorldWideWeb/old/research/dialogue/LocalDocs**
6. **bash /Docs/updateLocalDocs.sh**

Step 3 creates/updates the HTML files (which can be found in your local directory **/_build/**).  Step 6 then copies these over to LocalDocs.

You shouldn't have to do anything directly with Sphinx .rst files here. The documentation is all collected from the comments within the python code.
The format is simple and the easiest way to understand is to look at a python functions docstring and compare to the sphinx generated html.
Otherwise there are some useful links at the end of this page, or Google!
Note that there is a file **conf.py** in the repository root which is the config for Sphinx, but there should be no need to modify this.
